## Inspiration

We were inspired by our love for Sanrio and our passion for programming and trying innovative new solutions.

## What it does

We've crafted a web novel game that combines storytelling with financial education. Players navigate financial challenges, learn, and level up. The game/web-novel has interactive choices, mini-games, budgeting tips, and user incentives. It's mobile-friendly with a clear monetization plan for Sanrio character enthusiasts.

## How we built it

We explored the usage of renpy in order to create an interactive web-novel, as well as the use of javascript and html to create a website that showcases it. We are hosting it via itch.io.

## Challenges we ran into

A challenge we ran into was the division of tasks due to the inexperience of 3/4th of our group. We each learned on the spot and had to explore an assortment of resources such as youtube videos, and a multitude of informative websites.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of what the web-novel looks like at the end of the 24 hours, seeing as most of us were completely new to renpy as well as the manipulation of images/GUIs to fit pixel-wise/background/aesthetics. Although we did not have any experience; we were able to incorporate our love for interactive, player-friendly, engaging web-novels and the challenge proposed by CapitalOne together.

## What we learned

3/4th of our team had never attended a hackathon, much less used renpy; which is a free software game engine which facilitates the creation of visual novels. We learned of itch.io, where we can host our web-novel/game.

## What's next for PennyPie

We hope to be able to extend the routes, as well as level up the graphics seeing as we could only do so much with 24 hours and our inexperience.
